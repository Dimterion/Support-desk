# Support desk app

Udemy course project to learn React

## Details

This is an application to create, edit and update support site tickets. It is a part of the [React Front to Back Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/).

Project was deployed on Heroku initially. I haven't yet decided if I want to continue using this service after its changes or switch to something else, that's why there is no live demo (the app is functioning locally however).

Same as with the [House Marketplace project](https://github.com/Dimterion/House-marketplace), I'm planning to restructure this project and create something else out of it if I have the time (in that case it will be done as a separate repo).

I'm keeping this one as a course project reference with the main code structure for now.

## Built with

React, React Router, MongoDB, Express, Node.js Prettier
